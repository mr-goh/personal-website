            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>For my master's thesis at MIT, I wanted to develop a UX project where I could hone my user research skills and gain hands-on experience with UX/UI design. I also wanted the project to have personal meaning for me.</p>
            <p>I am Cambodian-American, and am really interested in small businesses. So I decided to focus on problems facing Cambodian small businesses in the U.S</p>
            <p>From initial site visits, data analysis, and interviews with key stakeholders, I found that while traditional brick-and-mortar Cambodian small businesses struggle with customer acquisition, there are a growing number of Cambodian-American digital creators making a living by creating content promoting Cambodian businesses.</p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>How might we improve Cambodian-American digital creators to increase customer acquisition and discoverability among Cambodian-American small businesses?</p>
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>I conducted 10 in-depth interviews with target users</p>
            <p>6 interviews with digital creators focused on their current business landscape, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Current goals for their business</li>
                <li>Main tasks and how they accomplish them</li>
                <li>Major pain-points in completing their tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>4 interviews with consumers focused on place-discovery, covering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Objectives when looking for new places and things to do</li>
                <li>Current tools and behaviors for place-discovery</li>
                <li>Major-pain points when it comes to place-discovery</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>User Personas</h3>
            <p>Since the problem involves two separate user groups, I identified two primary personas from my user interviews:</p>
            <p>The Digital Culture Creator wants to create content with local businesses, but have a hard time making connections beyond family for engagement, participation, and collaboration on projects.</p>
            <img src="images/personas_digital.png" class="slides">
            <p>The Tactical Wanderer wants to find local businesses that fit their needs in a particular moment, but feel like it's difficult to find relevant details and reccomendations in one place.</p>
            <img src="images/personas_tactical.png" class="slides">

            <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>
            <p>Digital Culture Creators involve personal and community connections throughout their process of generating content with local businesses.</p>
            <img src="images/journeyMap_dc.png" class="slides">
            <p>Tactical Wanderers look to digital platforms to discover new businesses and specific details that will help them make decisions about whether or not to go to a businessâ€“but few platforms do both well.</p>
            <img src="images/journeyMap_tactical.png" class="slides">
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>I centered the design process on addressing the most critical needs and processes for project promotion and connection-building expressed by Cambodian-American digital creators, and comprehensive place decision-making for Tactical Wanderers.</p>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct survey among Cambodian American businesses to ensure qualitative findings on core pain-points and goals are generalizable</li>
                <li>Conduct survey among consumers to validate qualitative findings on core pain-points and user goals, and identify any differentiation between subgroups</li>
                <li>Conduct moderated usability testing of low-fidelity prototypes to test key assumptions</li>
                <li>Refine prototype based on survey and usability testing, before conducting more comprehensive usability testing</li>
            </ul>
