                    <h2>Data exploration</h2>
                    <p>The U.S. Department of Energy, working with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, has generated a publicly available dataset to examine the relationship between different building characteristics and energy consumption. The dataset was generated by calibrating and validating a physics-based simulation model of US-wide building stocks with 548,912 observations and 227 variables.</p>
                    <h3>Response variable</h3>
                    <p>We picked net energy consumption in kWh as our response variable. This measures the total energy consumption minus the total on-site energy production.</p>
                    <p>The top five contributors to electricity consumption are cooling, plugs, heating, interior lighting, and hot water system. A photovoltaic panel helps offset some consumption, but this is very small compared to the overall consumption.</p>
                    <img src="images/machineLearning/response_distribution.png">
                    <h3>Predictor variables</h3>
                    <img src="images/machineLearning/predictor_map.png">
                    <img src="images/machineLearning/predictor_climateZone.png">
                    <p>The data we have is distributed across the US states, except for Alaska. Most data are in California, Texas, Florida, and New York State. The state with the least data is Wyoming, with 1,106 data points. Most data points are distributed in cold, mixed-humid, and hot-humid climate zone.</p>    
                    <img src="images/machineLearning/predictor_housingType.png">
                    <p>Most homes in the dataset are single-family detached homes. Other types represented in this dataset are mobile homes, multi-family, and single-family attached. In the visualization, we see that multi-family homes tend to consume less net electricity relative to single-family homes. Furthermore, buildings with wooden frames consume less energy than buildings constructed with other materials, except for steel frame buildings with more than 5 units.</p>
                    <img src="images/machineLearning/predictor_cooling.png">
                    <p>We know that air conditioning is the building element that consumes the most electricity on average. Buildings with poor efficiency AC systems, such as SEER 8 and heat pumps, tend to consume more electricity than the average.</p>

                    <h2>Modeling</h2>
                    <h3>Baseline model</h3>
                    <p>Our initial preprocessing gives us a dataset with more than 500,000 observations and 569 predictors. We split the dataset with an 80:20 proportion between the training and testing dataset. As a baseline model, we use a simple multi-linear model to predict total net energy consumption. Given that we have more than 500 predictors in various units, we standardized the units using the sklearn standard scaler. This way, we can visualize the relative importance of each predictor variable. This baseline result is quite promising since the model already explained 72% of what is happening in the dataset.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>train_MSE: 17,989,372.20</li>
                        <li>test_MSE: 18,231,309.62</li>
                        <li>r²: 0.72</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Lasso regularization</h3>
                    <p>Even though our baseline model performs well in prediction using the test dataset, it is not easily interpretable given the large predictor space. Therefore, we want to reduce the dimensionality without sacrificing much of the r2 score. The goal is to improve the readability and interpretability of our model. We utilized a lasso regularization process and tested multiple alphas to determine how much we could reduce the predictor space. As a result, we managed to reduce the number of predictors from 569 variables to 122 variables without sacrificing the accuracy of our model. With this finding, we are going to use this reduced dataset for further model selection to improve interpretability and to reduce computing time.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alpha: 100</li>
                        <li>Predictor count: 122</li>
                        <li>train_MSE: 18,567,502.81</li>
                        <li>test_MSE: 18,807,948.23</li>
                        <li>r²: 0.71</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Dealing with collinearity</h3>
                    <p>We dealt with collinearity by plotting out a bivariate correlation matrix of our predictors. We found that 13 predictors have correlation coefficients higher than 0.8 within our predictor space. We deal with this by dropping some of the collinear variables instead of making interaction terms as we want to optimize computing speed. As a result, we ended up with 107 predictors.</p>
                    <h3>Polynomial model</h3>
                    <p>Based on the residual plot of our baseline model, we know that our model might be non-linear. We want to test this by generating polynomial features for our numerical variables. We did not generate polynomial features for many binary/boolean variables as we deemed them inefficient. We iterate multiple degrees up until the fifth-polynomial degree. We found that the best degree that minimizes test MSE is 4. However the polynomial model does not significantly improve our baseline model.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Best degree = 4</li>
                        <li>Train MSE: 18,207,457.16</li>
                        <li>Test MSE: 18,660,143.63</li>
                        <li>r²: 0.718</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Decision Tree</h3>
                    <p>We fit an initial decision tree regression on our training dataset. We determined the optimal tree depth using a 5-fold cross validation, testing tree depths ranging from 1–20. We identified a maximum tree depth of 14 based on the highest mean validation accuracy score from our cross-validation.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maximum depth = 14</li>
                        <li>Mean = 0.8097</li>
                        <li>+/-2 standard deviation = [0.8049, 0.8146]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/machineLearning/treeDepth.png">
                    <p>Once we determined our optimal tree depth, we ran the decision tree regression model with a tree depth of 14 on both the training and test datasets, and calculated their accuracy scores.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depth = 14</li>
                        <li>Train accuracy = 0.8671</li>
                        <li>Test accuracy = 0.8190</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Using the decision tree regression gives us better results than the baseline model, however, we can improve on this model using ensemble methods.</p>
                    <h3>Bagging</h3>
                    <p>We implemented a bagging model using 100 bootstrapped samples, to create decision trees with a tree depth of 14. We ran the fitted model on the training and test data.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number of bootstrapped samples = 100</li>
                        <li>Depth = 14</li>
                        <li>Train r-squared = 0.8881</li>
                        <li>Test r-squared = 0.8565</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Using this ensemble learning method, we have improved the accuracy of our model applied to the test data compared to the single decision tree model.</p>
                    <h3>Random Forest</h3>
                    <p>We acknowledge that the bagging model increases collinearity by bootstrapping the ensemble trees. The Random Forest model helps with de-correlating trees and helps with over-fitting. We utilized 20 max tree depths and 100 trees in our Random Forest model and yielded a better result than the bagging model.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tree depth = 20</li>
                        <li>Number of trees = 100</li>
                        <li>train_accuracy= 0.9634</li>
                        <li>test_accuracy= 0.8917</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/machineLearning/randomForest.png">
                    <p>We also visualized the feature importance in this model using the mean decrease impurity (MDI). Some important features in this model are building size, heating type, cooling type, vacancy rates, building age, and the number of occupants.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="findingsContent" class="hidden machineLearning">
                    <h2>Findings</h2>
                    <p>We constructed the baseline model using simple linear regression. Despite the relatively high r² score, a model with so many predictors is difficult to interpret. To help with interpretability, we tried reducing the dimensions by checking collinearity and using lasso regularization. These steps help reduce the predictor space while maintaining accuracy, as proven by the negligible decline in r². We also tried checking possible polynomial dimensions in our predictors, but our polynomial model resulted in a lower r² than the baseline. One possible explanation is that we only tried testing a small number of degrees due to our lack of computing power. Further testing with higher polynomial degrees and conducting cross-validation may be needed.</p>
                    <p>We discarded the polynomial features in ensemble learning but maintained the reduced dataset from the lasso regularization. Our prediction progressively improves as we move through different ensemble models: decision trees, bagging, and random forest. Across these three models, random forest performs the best. We believe that this is because the model de-correlates dependent trees and handles over-fitting.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we generated a feature importance plot to see which variables contribute the most to the model. Building size as the top predictor is intuitive, as larger buildings require more electricity to operate. Heat types & cooling types are important, but interestingly building temperature baseline (temperature setpoints) is also highly important. Another interesting finding is that buildings without attics require more electricity. This might be explained by the fact that attics help to preserve heat.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, our prediction model seems satisfactory as we yielded a high test accuracy score while managing to reduce dimensionality. We hope that this model can be utilized by end-users, such as homeowners, architects, builders, and local government, to push the agenda of building electrification as a means of built-environment decarbonization. By identifying key predictors, we can help policymakers to optimize energy consumption–including demand response (DR), demand-side management (DSM), pricing policies, and building regulations.</p>

                <div id="limitationsContent" class="hidden machineLearning">
                    <h2>Limitations</h2>
                    <p>We acknowledge that our dataset does not contain data from Alaska state. This is something that we cannot help with data pre-processing and engineering, as this is related to the data collection itself. Therefore, this model might not accurately predict electricity usage in Alaska. Furthermore, Alaska’s climate is different than the rest of the country. We need to train a new model to predict electricity consumption in Alaska.</p>
                    <p>This dataset also lacks the element of individual behavior. This might be important as it could help address behavioral factors related to energy consumption. This dataset is only limited to residential buildings. Therefore the model is not generalizable to other types of buildings that might be a better target for policy changes. Our model is also limited to the US context only. As different countries have varying geographical conditions, building types, and appliances, we might need to train a different model for each country, given that similar data is available.</p>
                    <p>Another caveat in our prediction is that the response variable is not normalized. In the future, we can try predicting net electricity usage per square footage or per capita. This might provide different insights and might help improve interpretability. Wilson et. al conducted a similar simulation in which they translated the outcome variables into monetary values that significantly helps with end-user decision-making process.</p>

                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>Our team set out to solve the problem of grocery transport for people who do not use a car to get to and from the grocery store.</p>
                        <img src="images/groceryTransport/problemStats.png">
                        <p>Together with secondary research in the problem space, we conducted interviews with people who grocery shop regularly to better understand their grocery shopping journey, and needs related to transporting their groceries. We focused on grocery shoppers who make their trips using means other than a motor vehicle.</p>

                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>The "European refugee crisis" in 2015 was characterized by an sharp increase in the number of refugees applying for asylum in Europeam countries like Germany. This sudden arrival of asylum seekers left many European countries and their respective municipal governments with the challenge of resettling large numbers of refugees given insufficient resources.</p>
                        <p>Myself and three other students formed a team to address the problem:</p>
                        <p><strong>How might we improve the resettlement process for refugees and asylum seekers in Munich, Germany?</strong></p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="methodsContent" class="hidden refugeeIntegration">
                        <h2>Methods</h2>
                        <p>We developed a mixed-methods research study that collected and analyzed consumption data from asylum seekers in Munich, Germany. We partnered with the Munich municipal government, and two local German-language schools to recruit study participants. We recruited <strong>30 participants</strong>, who were refugees from <strong>9 different countries</strong>, seeking aslyum in Germany.</p>

                        <img src="images/refugeeIntegration/housingType.png">
                        <p>For the first part of our study, we gave each participant 60 euros as an unconditional cash transfer–meaning they could spend it on anything they wanted over the period of one week. We instructed each participant to take photos of the items they purchased as well as the receipt.</p>

                        <img src="images/refugeeIntegration/receiptFood.jpg">
                        <p>At the end of the week, we conducted <strong>hour-long in-depth interviews</strong> with each of the <strong>30 participants</strong> covering the following topics:</p>
                        <ul class="content">
                            <li>How they made their purchase decisions</li>
                            <li>Their resettlement journey</li>
                            <li>Challenges they experienced with the existing resettlement process</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to the qualitative user interviews, we also conducted a quantitative analysis using participants' spending data from the unconditional cash transfer exercise.</p>
                        <p>Using this mixed-methods approach we identified key needs and pain-points for refugees seeking asylum in Munich, Germany.</p>

                        <h2>Findings</h2>
                        <p>One of the primary goals for refugees seeking asylum in Germany was to feel like they belonged and had control over their lives in their city of resettlement. We found that items participants purchased fell into three categories:</p> 
                        <ul class="content">
                            <li>Clothing</li>
                            <li>Food</li>
                            <li>Gifts</li>
                        </ul> 
                        <p>The purchases asylum seekers made in these categories typically contributed to their overarching goal of finding agency and belonging–things that the existing resettlement system was not providing.</p>

                        <h3>Clothing</h3>
                        <p>While participants said choosing their own clothing is not an immediate physical need, selecting and buying their own clothes is an important medium for self expression and empowerment.</p>
                        <p>Participants expressed discomfort in having to wear secondhand clothing that continually label them as “refugees”, a population considered in need of charity.</p>
                        <img src="images/refugeeIntegration/clothes.jpeg">
                        <img src="images/refugeeIntegration/shoes.jpeg">
                        <p class="quote">“I received second-hand clothing and it was a strange feeling. So the first thing I did was to go to [named store] and buy some clothes that I could choose and I can dress in and I can feel comfortable in and be happy with.”</p>
                        <p>Most participants we spoke with felt little control over their lives in Germany. They could not control where they lived, worked, what they ate, what they wore or what they studied. In this context, the act of choosing their own clothes is a rare chance for individual self-expression.</p>
                        <p>Purchasing clothes not only contributes to participants' sense of empowerment and self expression, but also helps them integrate into their surrounding communities in Germany.</p>
                        <p class="quote">"For me, we are familiar with those clothes [from Afghanistan] but now we are ok with these [German clothes]. And also this is my first time that I’m wearing pants with shirts, these things. I have only used them before in cricket."</p>
                        <h3>Food</h3>
                        <p>Most camp residents are not allowed to cook for themselves, limiting their eating choices to the food served in the cafeteria, the preparation of which they have no control. Participants expressed distaste for the catered food because it is not culturally relevant nor appetizing.</p>
                        <p class="quote">“We didn’t have money, so we were just eating from the camps. And normally, they cook for everyone, not individually. ...I don’t like lots of the food provided by the camp, so sometimes we didn’t eat…We had doubts about the meat. What is it? Did they cook it in our way, like how we cook? If we had money at that time, we could cook for ourselves.”</p>
                        <img src="images/refugeeIntegration/groceries.jpeg" class="fullImg">
                        <p>Participants typically purchased food to cook with other people. Even those living in camps with catered food often bought supplies to contribute to communal cooking.</p>
                        <p class="quote">“I bought these groceries because then I can cook and eat with my friends. We all share... you buy, then I cook and you cook and then we eat all together. For Ramadan we cooked together.”</p>
                        <p>Cooking and eating culturally relevant food in a communal setting provided participants an everyday form of social support in an unfamiliar place. The cafeteria-style food catering system in camps was not conducive to communal forms of meal preparation and consumption.</p>

                        <h3>Gifts</h3>
                        <p>Whether the gift be for a birthday or Ramadan, the gifts serve as a means to strengthen relationships. Although the presence of a familial community remains limited in Germany, participants work to overcome bureaucratic loopholes in order to maintain these strong family ties.</p>
                        <p>Consider the example of Hadi from Pakistan. When asked how he spent the cash transfer, he explained how every year for his niece’s birthday, he would give her a present. But this year, given his situation, it was near impossible to do so. His status as an asylum seeker prohibits him from sending money or other items back to his family in Pakistan. Given the restrictions, Hadi tried to find a way around them. He used the cash-transfer to buy a pair of shoes, which he then gave to his roommate, who then phoned his brother in Pakistan and asked him to send a doll to Hadi’s niece on his behalf.</p>

                    <div id="recommendationsContent" class="hidden refugeeIntegration">
                        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                        <p>Based on our findings from user research with refugees seeking asylum in Germany, we developed design recommendations to improve exisiting refugee integration processes and programs. We presented our findings and recommendations to key stakeholders within the municipal government of Munich, Germany.</p>
                        <h3>Develop avenues for independent clothing & food purchases</h3>
                        <p>We recommend a discounted clothing option for all asylum seekers with monthly income of less than €400. Similar to a thrift shop, donated clothes can be arranged in a store like setting and sold for discounted prices. Asylum seekers will then be able to make their own clothing and purchasing choices. Although we see this as the best and most affordable option, vouchers to  existing clothing stores like H&M, C&A, Zara, or Lady.Mister, could also be an alternative.</p>
                        <h3>Support adaptation to long term reality in camps</h3>
                        <p>Many of the camps where asylum seekers live were originally designed as short-term reception centres. However, the reality is that the camp becomes a longer-term home and, as such, its physical infrastructure as well as arrangements such as food catering should be adapted to this reality if asylum seekers are to maintain their physical and mental health. Service providers should, for example, recognise the dual roles of cooking, buying and eating food both as a way for maintaining previous cultural practices and simultaneously as a basic way for learning to navigate and belong in a new place.</p>
                        <h3>Pair asylum seekers with local families</h3>
                        <p>We met a number of asylum seekers in Munich who have connected with local German families. Through these relationships, asylum seekers find stability and guidance by spending time with the families in a location that is not the camp, and also improve their German language skills. The local families, in turn, are able to serve as mentors, learn about a new culture, and engage in dialogue. More relationships like these could be created through a formalised ‘host family’ program.</p>
