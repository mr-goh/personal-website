        <h2>Compendium</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my 3D Compendium. A compendium is defined as “a collection of things, especially one systematically gathered.” In this compendium, I am creating a collection of 3D virtual objects that I am designing as I learn 3D modeling in Blender and Three.js.</p>
        <p>So why am I doing this?</p>
        <p>I was inspired by <a href="https://jonnysun.com/">Jonny Sun’s</a> “Small list of knowable things” where every week he drew an item that was personal to him and wrote an accompanying reflective essay about the object.</p>
        <p>When I first came across his work, it spoke to me because of my background in Anthropology, and how we learn that everyday objects are imbibed with meaning.</p>
        <p>For me, this idea gives objects a magical quality, which I think 3D modeling can capture really well (think about the last Pixar movie you saw!).</p>
        <p>As with many things in life, people teaching 3D modeling often encourage you to start with a simple object (in my case, a donut) so that you don’t give up. So creating a compendium of simple everyday objects aligns really nicely with the learning trajectory of 3D.</p>
        <p>I think the beauty I have found in 3D modeling is that it forces me to slow down. It asks me to pay attention and appreciate to the details of even ordinary objects, and I hope that here you are able to see some of the magic in them too.</p>
