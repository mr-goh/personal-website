            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>I conducted 12 in-depth interviews with craft business owners in Italy</p>
            <p> focused on their current business landscape, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Current goals for their business</li>
                <li>Main tasks and how they accomplish them</li>
                <li>Major pain-points in completing their tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>User interviews among small craft business owners in Italy revealed that they seek to increase customer acquisition by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building an online presence through social media, booking websites, and their personal business website</li>
                <li>Working together with other local businesses to create better experiences for tourists</li>
                <li>Documenting their craft using photos and videos</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, they encounter problems in reaching this goal because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of digital technology knowledge: Wide spectrum when it comes to technology adoption and knowledge</li>
                <li>Time constraints: They cannot run their business while also marketing</li>
                <li>Local infrastructure: Lack of local infrastructure makes it difficult to attract visitors</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilitate a personal connection with craft business owners and consumers (tourists)</li>
                <li>Enable business owners to upload storytelling content for their shop, as well as products available for sale</li>
                <li>Simplify coordination among local small businesses to create place-based experiences for tourists</li>
                <li>Make it easy for consumers to plan trips</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>We presented findings of our initial user research and concept development with stakeholders in the Italian government, and are currently working on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In-depth interviews with travel-minded consumers to understand goals and needs of other target user</li>
                <li>Survey among craft business owners in Italy to confirm generalizability of findings</li>
                <li>Test low-fidelity prototype for key user flows</li>
            </ul>
